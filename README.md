# Pig AI Disease Classification  

## Overview  
This project focuses on developing an AI-based system to classify pig diseases. The system uses deep learning techniques to analyze images of pigs and predict the likelihood of various diseases.  

## Important Files

## Data  
Due to the large size of the dataset, only a sample of the data is included in this repository.  

## Usage  
1. Refer to the research paper ([`documentation/ai_pig_disease_classification_research_paper.docx`](documentation/ai_pig_disease_classification_research_paper.docx)) for detailed insights and methodology.  
2. Use the [`implementation/VGG16_Pig_Disease_Classification.ipynb`](implementation/VGG16_Pig_Disease_Classification.ipynb) notebook in the `implementation` folder to run the AI classification model.
